# Hiya! I'm Jazza, your local lab experiment! (by lore) I love all things music, rhythm games, and gaming in general!

Likes: Food, tetris, osu!, fast paced games [like grace](https://www.roblox.com/games/138837502355157/Grace) cars, music, and chill, quiet spaces.
Dislikes: Overused memes, overused jokes, disrespectfulness even if its meant as a joke, you get the gist.
:sparkles: Traits :sparkles: 
Great with technology, open to hold conversation most of the time, trusting, and more (im lazy its 4:30 AM and ***I haven't slept***)
Disadvantages :slime_rave: 
Social anxiety, BPD, :sparkles: *severe* attachment issues :sparkles:, sensitive little goob, can go into way too much detail and overshare, gets easily overwhelmed.
